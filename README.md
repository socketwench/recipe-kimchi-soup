# Kimchi soup

There's nothing better than a hot, spicy soup when it's hot out, cold out, or if you're not feeling well. This soup is easy to make, stores well, and makes a lot.

The jar of kimchi makes all the difference in this one, so it might take a few tries before you find one that hits the spot. This recipe is really forgiving, so you can experiment with different veggies, serving with noodles, and so on.

## Ingredients

* A jar of pre-made kimchi, typically 16 to 32 oz.
* Protein of your choice; pork or tofu are common
* 8 or more cups of Chicken broth, depending on the size of the jar of kimchi.

## Directions

1. Combine kimchi and broth in a slow cooker or instant pot.
2. Add animal protein if using.
3. Slow cook for 10 hours, or use the pressure cook setting on your instant pot for 10 minutes.
4. Remove any animal protein from the soup and fork apart into spoonable pieces.
5. If using tofu, cut up, add to broth and let cook for several minutes until warm.
6. Serve with rice.
